\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}

The Standard Model of Particle Physics summarizes the current knowledge of fundamental particles and their interactions. The model holds at scales of 1 fm and below. Gravity, being the fourth fundamental force is not included because it is negligible for most phenomena at this scale.
The current view is that all matter is made out of three kinds of elementary particle being leptons quarks and mediators.
There are six leptons falling into three families according to charge, electron number, muon number and tau number. To each of these leptons there also is an antilepton with all signs reversed





\section{The LHC and ATLAS}

The analysis for this thesis has been performed in the ATLAS collaboration. The ATLAS-Detector is one of the four big experiments at the LHC at Cern. Therefore this chapter gives a brief overview over the LHC and ATLAS focusing on the properties directly relevant for Particle Flow Analysis.

\subsection{The LHC}

The Large Hadron Collider ("LHC") at CERN was built to extend the frontiers of modern particle physics by delivering high luminosities and unprecedented high energies.\\
The LHC is designed to collide bunches of up to \num{d11} protons

\subsection{The ATLAS Detector}

\section{The Particle Flow Algorithm}

Recently only either the Calorimeter or the tracker information was used to reconstruct Jets in ATLAS events. The Particle Flow Algorithm combines tracker and calorimeter information to achieve better resolution especially at lower energies. The main advantages of including the tracker information into reconstruction are listed here:

\begin{itemize}
\item better resolution at low pt
\item better angular resolution
\item better tru
\end{itemize}
