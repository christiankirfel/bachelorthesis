\section{Event Selection}

For this thesis $Z\rightarrow \mu \mu$ events were used. 
The criteria for the event selection were no good electrons and exactly two good muons, with opposite charge where good means that the particle passed all selection filters itself. The reconstructed Z-Boson is required to be in an range of \SI{90+-10}{\GeV} and to have a transversal momentum greater than \SI{30}{\GeV} while the muons are required to have a transversal momentum greater than \SI{25}{\GeV}
